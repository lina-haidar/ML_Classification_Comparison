# ML_Classification_Comparison

In this project, I am comparing six classification models to predict if a person will default on a loan. The models are: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, KNN, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. The dataset I am using is in the folder 'data'. 

The steps that I follow in the jupyter notebook are: 1- pre-processing the data 2- study correlation coefficients 3-Cross validation 4-Visualization of confusion matrix of all the models 5- Analyze ROC Curves 6- Manually adjusting the threshold

Results and Discussion are included in a pdf file as a presentation.
